![alt Bitmap to Svg](docimages/s1.png)
Simple raster image tracer and vectorizer written in Java for Android. See https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjava for the desktop Java version.

by AndrÃ¡s Jankovics 2015, 2016

This is the Android version of ImageTracer.java, please read that for more details: https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjava

The library:
imagetracerandroid/src/jankovicsandras/imagetracerandroid/ImageTracerAndroid.java

Sample Activity:
imagetracerandroid/src/jankovicsandras/imagetracerapp/ImagetracerActivity.java

Android application:
imagetracerandroid/bin/ImageTracerApp.apk

The whole package is an Android project.

I will try to update this documentation as soon as I have enough time. :)

### 1.1.2

- minor bugfixes
- lookup based ```pathscan()```

### 1.1.1

- Bugfix: CSS3 RGBA output in SVG was technically incorrect (however supported by major browsers), so this is changed. [More info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6042550/svg-fill-color-transparency-alpha)
- transparency support: alpha is not discarded now, it is given more weight in color quantization
- new ```options.roundcoords``` : rounding coordinates to a given decimal place. This can reduce SVG length significantly (>20%) with minor loss of precision.
- new ```options.desc``` : setting this to false will turn off path descriptions, reducing SVG length.
- new ```options.viewbox``` : setting this to true will use viewBox instead of exact width and height
- new ```options.colorsampling``` : color quantization will sample the colors now by default, can be turned off.
- new ```options.blurradius``` : setting this to 1..5 will preprocess the image with a selective Gaussian blur with options.blurdelta treshold. This can filter noise and improve quality.
- ```IndexedImage``` has width and height
- ```getsvgstring()``` needs now only IndexedImage (tracedata) and options as parameters
- ```colorquantization()``` needs now only imgd, palette and options as parameters
- background field is removed from the results of color quantization 


### Deterministic output

### Main Functions
|Function name|Arguments|Returns|
|-------------|---------|-------|
|```imageToSVG```|```String filename, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```String /*SVG content*/```|
|```imageToSVG```|```Bitmap bitmap, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```String /*SVG content*/```|
|```imagedataToSVG```|```ImageData imgd, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```String /*SVG content*/```|
|```imageToTracedata```|```String filename, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```IndexedImage /*read the source for details*/```|
|```imageToTracedata```|```Bitmap bitmap, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```IndexedImage /*read the source for details*/```|
|```imagedataToTracedata```|```ImageData imgd, HashMap<String,Float> options /*can be null*/, byte [][] palette /*can be null*/```|```IndexedImage /*read the source for details*/```|

#### Helper Functions
|Function name|Arguments|Returns|
|-------------|---------|-------|
|```saveString```|```String filename, String str```|```void```|
|```loadImageData```|```String filename```|```ImageData /*read the source for details*/```|
|```loadImageData```|```Bitmap bitmap```|```ImageData /*read the source for details*/```|

```ImageData``` is similar to [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData) here.

There are more functions for advanced users, read the source if you are interested. :)
	
### Options
|Option name|Default value|Meaning|
|-----------|-------------|-------|
|```ltres```|```1f```|Error treshold for straight lines.|
|```qtres```|```1f```|Error treshold for quadratic splines.|
|```pathomit```|```8f```|Edge node paths shorter than this will be discarded for noise reduction.|
|```colorsampling```|```1f```|Enable or disable color sampling. 1f is on, 0f is off.|
|```numberofcolors```|```16f```|Number of colors to use on palette if pal object is not defined.|
|```mincolorratio```|```0.02f```|Color quantization will randomize a color if fewer pixels than (total pixels*mincolorratio) has it.|
|```colorquantcycles```|```3f```|Color quantization will be repeated this many times.|
|```blurradius```|```0f```|Set this to 1f..5f for selective Gaussian blur preprocessing.|
|```blurdelta```|```20f```|RGBA delta treshold for selective Gaussian blur preprocessing.|
|```scale```|```1f```|Every coordinate will be multiplied with this, to scale the SVG.|
|```roundcoords```|```1f```|rounding coordinates to a given decimal place. 1f means rounded to 1 decimal place like 7.3 ; 3f means rounded to 3 places, like 7.356|
|```viewbox```|```0f```|Enable or disable SVG viewBox. 1f is on, 0f is off.|
|```desc```|```1f```|Enable or disable SVG descriptions. 1f is on, 0f is off.|
|```lcpr```|```0f```|Straight line control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
|```qcpr```|```0f```|Quadratic spline control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles and lines will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
