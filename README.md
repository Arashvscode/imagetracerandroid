![alt Bitmap to Svg](docimages/s1.png)
Simple raster image tracer and vectorizer written in Java for Android. See https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjava for the desktop Java version.

by AndrÃ¡s Jankovics 2015, 2016

This is the Android version of ImageTracer.java, please read that for more details: https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjava

The library:
imagetracerandroid/src/jankovicsandras/imagetracerandroid/ImageTracerAndroid.java

Sample Activity:
imagetracerandroid/src/jankovicsandras/imagetracerapp/ImagetracerActivity.java

Android application:
imagetracerandroid/bin/ImageTracerApp.apk

The whole package is an Android project.

I will try to update this documentation as soon as I have enough time. :)

### 1.1.1

- Bugfix: CSS3 RGBA output in SVG was technically incorrect (however supported by major browsers), so this is changed. [More info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6042550/svg-fill-color-transparency-alpha)
- transparency support: alpha is not discarded now, it is given more weight in color quantization
- new options.roundcoords : rounding coordinates to a given decimal place. This can reduce SVG length significantly (>20%) with minor loss of precision.
- new options.desc : setting this to false will turn off path descriptions, reducing SVG length.
- new options.viewbox : setting this to true will use viewBox instead of exact width and height
- new options.colorsampling : color quantization will sample the colors now by default, can be turned off.
- new options.blurradius : setting this to 1..5 will preprocess the image with a selective Gaussian blur with options.blurdelta treshold. This can filter noise and improve quality.
- IndexedImage has width and height
- getsvgstring() needs now only IndexedImage (tracedata) and options as parameters
- colorquantization() needs now only imgd, palette and options as parameters
- background field is removed from the results of color quantization 

### Options
|Option name|Default value|Meaning|
|-----------|-------------|-------|
|ltres|1|Error treshold for straight lines.|
|qtres|1|Error treshold for quadratic splines.|
|pathomit|8|Edge node paths shorter than this will be discarded for noise reduction.|
|blurradius|0|Set this to 1..5 for selective Gaussian blur preprocessing.|
|blurdelta|20|RGBA delta treshold for selective Gaussian blur preprocessing.|
|numberofcolors|16|Number of colors to use on palette if pal object is not defined.|
|mincolorratio|0.02|Color quantization will randomize a color if fewer pixels than (total pixels*mincolorratio) has it.|
|colorquantcycles|3|Color quantization will be repeated this many times.|
|scale|1|Every coordinate will be multiplied with this, to scale the SVG.|
|colorsampling|1|Enable or disable color sampling. 1 is on, 0 is off.|
|viewbox|0|Enable or disable SVG viewBox. 1 is on, 0 is off.|
|desc|1|Enable or disable SVG descriptions. 1 is on, 0 is off.|
|lcpr|0|Straight line control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
|qcpr|0|Quadratic spline control point radius, if this is greater than zero, small circles and lines will be drawn in the SVG. Do not use this for big/complex images.|
